## Assessment 2 - Team

You've worked iteratively (_formative_) on your product and finish with an oral test (_summative_) where you **present your final prototype** with your **team**. You've combined all your job stories into one complete matching application. It's important that your team makes decisions together based on consensus. Also, split work per feature (such as liking) instead of per area (such as templating).

First you'll present the whole project as a team to all the teachers. Then you'll show how you contributed to the project and explain if you reached your own goals you've set at the beginning of the project. 

You will answer questions in such a way as to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of our goals.

> **This is a team assignment but you'll be graded individually!** Each prototype contains an individually recognizable contribution of you based on the learning goals and topics of this course. So, you need to show you worked on something for back-end. For example; you can't just _work on the CSS of the project_ because that was your role in the team.

> **This is an assessment, not another moment for feedback.** So you will be graded. There isn't much time for additional feedback or troubleshooting technical issues.

### Recording a video
Besides the individual oral test you'll _present your application with your team_ by **recording a 8-10 minute video**. Which acts as a replacement of a live presentation in front of a classroom. Your teacher will watch the video before the individual assessment.

To give you a suggestion on how to approach this; hop on a MS teams call with all your team members and hit record. Show what the web application can do and then have each team member explain how they contributed. Alternatively you can pre-record your video (use quicktime, loom etc.) and have someone edit it into a coherent video. It's up to your team on how to approach this.

> Make sure you hand-in your video in **the assignment on Brightspace**.

### Preparation

Since we have limited time make sure you come to the assessment prepared:

- **Bring your computer** and make sure it's _charged_ and connected to _Wifi_.
- Make sure your _webcam_, _microphone_ and _screen sharing_ **works in MS Teams**
- Have the latest version of your feature **ready in your browser**.
- Have the latest version of your code and wiki **ready on GitHub**.
- Have the latest version of your code **ready in your editor**.

> Make sure your repository stays online after the assessment is finished, we might want to check the code handed in on GitHub after the assessment. We also want to download and archive your project when it’s done.

> **Note:**  
> _You'll need a > 5.5 for each row to pass:_ you can't compensate between rows.  
> _Each of this rubric’s rows is cumulative:_ for example, to get a 5-6 on concept, you also need to have a 1-2 and 3-4.

### Guidelines
* A teacher can [refuse to take the assessment][refuse] when you show up late regardless of the reason. That means you go straight to the re-sits and will be graded with a `1.0`. Usually teachers give you a small window of time after the assessment(~5 minutes) to show up.
* We don’t like plagiarism and report it to our assessment committee (examencommissie in Dutch).
* Grades will be published and communicated trough MS Teams. We also publish grade lists on Brightspace based on student numbers.
