Describe and design what your team is going to build. Use techniques such as, wireframes, job stories and [other methods](https://cmdmethods.nl).

* Describe the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** you are planning to build. Which team member is going to work on what feature?
* Determine the **git strategy**. How are you going to work with the feature from GitHub? How do you make sure you review eachother's code?
* Take time to decide the **code style and standard** that your team will adhere to during the rest of the project. Are you going to use `es5` or `es6`? How are you going to setup your linting rules?

#### Assignment

Document everything your team came up with in the _GitHub wiki_ of your Team repo.
